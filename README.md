# Catmotion

This repository contains all the code regarding the catmotion project developed in the context of the Advanced Seminar Collaborative Innovation Networks. 
In this project two convolutional neural networks for predicting a cats' emotion from sound were developed. The code used to develop these models can be found in the [model](https://github.com/diego411/catmotion/tree/master/model) directory. 
Furthermore a mobile app was developed using the flutter framework to provide an interface to the machine learning models. The respective code can be found in the [app](https://github.com/diego411/catmotion/tree/master/app) directory. 
An API allowing the app to query the models can be found in the [server](https://github.com/diego411/catmotion/tree/master/server) directory.
If you want to try out the app you can download the apk under [releases](https://github.com/diego411/catmotion/releases).
